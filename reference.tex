\section{Reference, for Beckett and Ferin}
Basically just look at the custom commands in the style package, and use them as needed. 
Specifically for matrixes, use matr so the output is: $\matr{I}$. Use mvec for vectors
so output is $\mvec{x}$. And for isvd use the shortcuts mtrSig $\mtrSig$, mtrA $\mtrA$, mtrU $\mtrU$, and mtrV $\mtrV$.
Define more as you need.

Label everything, and use the convention sec:name for sections and subsections, eq:name, and fig:name.

Reference everthing using autref. Will save lots of time later
