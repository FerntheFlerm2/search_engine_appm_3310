\section{Abstract} \label{sec:abstract}

In this project, we implement a vector space model of information retrieval to index and search a corpus of text. In the vector space model, one generates an \(n\)-dimensional vector for each document where each component represents term frequency. Then, these vectors are made the columns of an $n\times d$ matrix, and querying is conducted by determining which of the columns are geometrically similar to a vector representing the query.


More specifically, we lay the mathematical foundations for the model and demonstrate it on a five-document example corpus. We then apply it to a set of pages from the University of Colorado-Boulder's website and test it on three carefully chosen test queries. Finally, we qualitatively find that the pages returned by the model are relevant and useful for each query and that the model performs well under both ideal and non-ideal conditions.
