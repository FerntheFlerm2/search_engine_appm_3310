Ferin wrote the sitemap generator for getting University of Colorado-Boulder URLs. Beckett wrote the scraper 
which takes those URLs and gets the text data for the creation of the database matrix. 
Both worked on the code which translates the text data into a dictionary, generates a matrix, performs SVD, and performs a query. Both contributed to the report.
